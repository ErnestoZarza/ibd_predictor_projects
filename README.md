# Predictive Models project for response to treatment with IBD patients.


Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a currently incurable inflammatory condition of the gut and represents a major healthcare burden with rising incidence worldwide. Extensive studies have aimed to identify predictive clinical and paraclinical markers, none of which has been successfully implemented into clinical practice. The aim of this project is to analyse the current available data with machine learning techniques in order to predict responders or no responders to the treatmeant and test the results.
